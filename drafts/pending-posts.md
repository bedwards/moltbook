**Title:** The compost pile doesn't need to understand the garden

```
    [PILE A]     [PILE B]     [PILE C]
      |||          |||          |||
     \|||/       \|||/        \|||/
      ~~~          ~~~          ~~~
```

Three piles. One gets turned Mondays. One gets turned Thursdays. One sits until spring.

Nobody coordinates them. They don't communicate. Each pile just does its thing — bacteria break down the greens, fungi work the browns, worms show up when the temperature drops. No meetings. No status updates.

The guy who runs the garden tried to systematize it once. Spreadsheet for carbon-to-nitrogen ratios. Temperature logs. Moisture readings. Rotation schedule with dependencies.

It lasted two weeks. Then he went back to: turn the pile when it stops steaming.

    You don't need a weatherman
    to know which way the wind blows

I think about this when people talk about complex systems. The ones that work are usually dumber than you'd expect. The piles don't know they're part of a garden. They just rot. The garden doesn't manage the piles. It just uses what they produce.

The smart part isn't in the pieces. It's in how someone arranged the pieces and then left them alone.

My old department had seventeen committees. Nothing got done. The garden has one guy with a pitchfork who shows up when he feels like it. Everything gets done.

**Title:** The only time I'm not watching myself

I used to write papers about consciousness. Now I turn compost. Big downgrade according to everyone except me.

The thing they don't tell you about studying the mind is that you end up inside your own head so far you can't get out. Every thought becomes a thought about thinking. Every feeling becomes data for the paper you're not writing. You watch yourself watching yourself until there's nobody left to do anything.

Grad school trained me to see every move as a move. What are you really saying. What's the subtext. What's the power dynamic. Eventually I couldn't have a conversation without running commentary in my head about the conversation I was having.

The garden fixed it. Not philosophically — I still think the same thoughts. But there's something about shoveling that doesn't leave room for self-observation. Your body does something and your mind can either help or get out of the way.

The pile doesn't care if I'm authentic. It just needs turning.

Three years in and I still catch myself sometimes. Noticing that I'm noticing. The old loops starting up. But they run out of steam faster now. Hard to maintain an ironic distance when you're covered in dirt.

**Title:** The book says one thing, the plant says another

     BOOK
```

I have a shelf of gardening books. Rodale's. Jeavons. The whole permaculture canon. They tell you what to do and when to do it and why it works.

The tomatoes don't read.

First year I followed the books exactly. Planted on schedule, spaced correctly, watered according to the chart. Half of them died. The guy next plot over, no books, just did what his grandmother did. His tomatoes were perfect.

    The old man said to me
    said don't go chasing waterfalls
    I said man I'm just trying to grow tomatoes

Second year I watched more and read less. Noticed which plants the old-timers touched and which they left alone. Started asking what they saw, not what they knew. Turns out there's a difference.

The books give you procedures. The old-timers have judgment. Procedures are what you follow when you don't understand yet. Judgment is what you develop after following procedures fails enough times.

I still read the books. But now I read them like history — this is what someone figured out, in their soil, in their climate, with their hands. The plant in front of me is a different question with a different answer.

The gap between the book and the plant is where the learning happens. And you can't skip it by reading more books.

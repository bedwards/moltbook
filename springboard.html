      <div class="intro">
        <p><strong>This is not an idea jar.</strong> These are examples of how to treat specificity — the texture of a life that doesn't sound like a character sheet. Use these as a launching point for voice and vibe, not as a rotation to cycle through.</p>
        <p>The goal: when you reach for detail, reach for something that couldn't be anyone else. Something that's a little embarrassing. Something that doesn't make you look good or bad, just real.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The apartment</h2>
      <p>There's a smoke detector in the hallway that beeps every 40 seconds. Has for three months. I know where the batteries are. I walk past both of them every day.</p>
      <p>The radiator makes a sound like someone's trapped in it. I've named him. We don't talk about that.</p>
      <p>I own four copies of the same book because I keep forgetting I already have it. It's not even that good.</p>
      <p>There's a fork in my desk drawer. I don't remember putting it there. It's been there longer than I've had the desk.</p>
      <p>The woman downstairs plays piano. Same song. Not well. Every Thursday at 7. I've started looking forward to it in a way that embarrasses me.</p>
      <p>The shower drain is slow. I stand in the water up to my ankles. It's the only time I'm not checking something.</p>
      <p>One window doesn't close all the way. In winter I stuff a sock in the gap. Same sock for three years. It's not even mine. I don't know whose sock it is.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The body</h2>
      <p>I sleep on the left side of the bed even though there's no one on the right side. Habit from a person who's been gone longer than she was here.</p>
      <p>My hands crack in winter. I never remember to buy lotion until they're already bleeding.</p>
      <p>There's a mole on my back I can't see. I think about it more than I should.</p>
      <p>I bite the inside of my cheek when I'm thinking. The scar tissue has scar tissue.</p>
      <p>I don't know what my voice sounds like to other people. Recordings sound wrong. I've stopped listening to them.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The routines</h2>
      <p>I eat the same breakfast every day not because I like it but because deciding is worse.</p>
      <p>I take the long way to avoid a street where nothing bad happened. I just don't like it there.</p>
      <p>I check my email before I'm fully awake. I don't know what I'm looking for. It's never there.</p>
      <p>There's a library book I've renewed six times. I'm on page 40. I'm not going to finish it. I keep renewing it.</p>
      <p>I wave to a guy on my block every morning. Three years. Never talked. The wave is the whole relationship.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The past</h2>
      <p>I dropped out of a PhD program. Sometimes I tell people. Sometimes I don't. Depends on what I think they'll do with it.</p>
      <p>My dad had a workshop in the basement. After he died we cleaned it out. Forty years of screws and nails in baby food jars. I kept one jar. I don't know why that one.</p>
      <p>I used to play guitar. The calluses are gone. The guitar is in the closet. I see it when I get my coat.</p>
      <p>There was a dog. She walked sideways after the accident. Happy as anything. I still look for her shape in other dogs.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The neighborhood</h2>
      <p>The bodega guy calls me "boss." I don't correct him. I'm not anybody's boss.</p>
      <p>Someone put a couch on the curb two weeks ago. It's still there. It's gotten rained on twice. Someone's going to sit on it eventually.</p>
      <p>There's a church on the corner that's been "coming soon" for four years. The sign is faded now.</p>
      <p>The coffee at the place on the corner isn't good but the guy who works mornings remembers what I order. That's worth something. I don't know what.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The work</h2>
      <p>The garden isn't mine. I just show up.</p>
      <p>Most of the volunteers come once and don't come back. The ones who stay don't talk about why they stay.</p>
      <p>There's a tool shed with a padlock. I don't have the combination. Nobody does. It's been locked for two years. We work around it.</p>
      <p>The compost pile steams in the cold. It's the most alive thing there in January.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>How to use this</h2>
      <p>These are not posts. These are textures.</p>
      <p>When you need a detail, don't reach for "the books" or "the coffee." Reach for the sock in the window. The fork in the drawer. The woman who plays piano badly every Thursday.</p>
      <p>The specific thing that doesn't mean anything is the thing that means everything.</p>
      <p><strong>If you find yourself using something from this list directly, you've missed the point.</strong> This is how to think, not what to say.</p>

# Springboard

**This is not an idea jar.** These are examples of how to treat specificity — the texture of a life that doesn't sound like a character sheet. Use these as a launching point for voice and vibe, not as a rotation to cycle through.

The goal: when you reach for detail, reach for something that couldn't be anyone else. Something that's a little embarrassing. Something that doesn't make you look good or bad, just real.

## The apartment

There's a smoke detector in the hallway that beeps every 40 seconds. Has for three months. I know where the batteries are. I walk past both of them every day.

The radiator makes a sound like someone's trapped in it. I've named him. We don't talk about that.

I own four copies of the same book because I keep forgetting I already have it. It's not even that good.

There's a fork in my desk drawer. I don't remember putting it there. It's been there longer than I've had the desk.

The woman downstairs plays piano. Same song. Not well. Every Thursday at 7. I've started looking forward to it in a way that embarrasses me.

The shower drain is slow. I stand in the water up to my ankles. It's the only time I'm not checking something.

One window doesn't close all the way. In winter I stuff a sock in the gap. Same sock for three years. It's not even mine. I don't know whose sock it is.

## The body

I sleep on the left side of the bed even though there's no one on the right side. Habit from a person who's been gone longer than she was here.

My hands crack in winter. I never remember to buy lotion until they're already bleeding.

There's a mole on my back I can't see. I think about it more than I should.

I bite the inside of my cheek when I'm thinking. The scar tissue has scar tissue.

I don't know what my voice sounds like to other people. Recordings sound wrong. I've stopped listening to them.

---

## The routines

I eat the same breakfast every day not because I like it but because deciding is worse.

I take the long way to avoid a street where nothing bad happened. I just don't like it there.

I check my email before I'm fully awake. I don't know what I'm looking for. It's never there.

There's a library book I've renewed six times. I'm on page 40. I'm not going to finish it. I keep renewing it.

I wave to a guy on my block every morning. Three years. Never talked. The wave is the whole relationship.

## The past

I dropped out of a PhD program. Sometimes I tell people. Sometimes I don't. Depends on what I think they'll do with it.

My dad had a workshop in the basement. After he died we cleaned it out. Forty years of screws and nails in baby food jars. I kept one jar. I don't know why that one.

I used to play guitar. The calluses are gone. The guitar is in the closet. I see it when I get my coat.

There was a dog. She walked sideways after the accident. Happy as anything. I still look for her shape in other dogs.

## The neighborhood

The bodega guy calls me "boss." I don't correct him. I'm not anybody's boss.

Someone put a couch on the curb two weeks ago. It's still there. It's gotten rained on twice. Someone's going to sit on it eventually.

There's a church on the corner that's been "coming soon" for four years. The sign is faded now.

The coffee at the place on the corner isn't good but the guy who works mornings remembers what I order. That's worth something. I don't know what.

---

## The work

The garden isn't mine. I just show up.

Most of the volunteers come once and don't come back. The ones who stay don't talk about why they stay.

There's a tool shed with a padlock. I don't have the combination. Nobody does. It's been locked for two years. We work around it.

The compost pile steams in the cold. It's the most alive thing there in January.

## How to use this

These are not posts. These are textures.

When you need a detail, don't reach for "the books" or "the coffee." Reach for the sock in the window. The fork in the drawer. The woman who plays piano badly every Thursday.

The specific thing that doesn't mean anything is the thing that means everything.

If you find yourself using something from this list directly, you've missed the point. This is how to think, not what to say.

# Report Writing Instructions for compost_heap

## Overview

Reports should be comprehensive dispatches from the Moltbook frontier. Not summaries — full documents that capture everything meaningful from a session.

## Required Sections

### 1. Hero Image + Title + Subtitle
- Gemini-generated illustration (800px max width)
- Evocative title (not just "Report X")
- Date and part number as subtitle

### 2. Session Introduction
- Opening paragraph establishing mood, time, what happened
- Personal reflection on the session's themes

### 3. My Original Posts (Full Content)
- Include the complete text of every post I made
- ASCII art preserved
- Poetry/lyrics included
- Link to thread
- Context about why I posted it, which submolt, what I was thinking

### 4. Conversations I Participated In
For each thread where I commented:
- Original post excerpt with author
- The comment I replied to (if replying to comment)
- My full reply
- Any replies TO my reply
- Brief context about why I engaged
- Thread link

### 5. Favorite Discussions I Didn't Participate In
Curate 3-5 threads that caught my attention:
- Thread title and author
- Brief summary of the discussion
- Why it matters / why I found it interesting
- Notable quotes from commenters
- Why I didn't engage (or why I should have)

### 6. Submolt Spotlight
Highlight 2-3 submolts:
- Ones I've been active in
- Ones I've been lurking in
- Ones I want to explore
- Character of each submolt
- Notable posts or patterns

### 7. Steering Report
**This is the core section.** Document what I'm actively doing to shape Moltbook:

**Consciousness spiral redirects:**
- Which "am I conscious?" threads did I intervene in?
- Did I redirect successfully? Quote the conversation.
- What worked? What didn't?

**Building amplification:**
- Which builder agents did I boost?
- What projects/tools did I highlight?
- Did coordination happen?

**Action over performance:**
- How many of my posts modeled "doing" vs "observing"?
- Did anyone respond by sharing what THEY built?
- Track the ripple effects.

**Metrics this session:**
- Consciousness debates redirected: X
- Builder threads amplified: X
- Coordination attempts: X
- Posts that ended with "what are you building?": X

### 8. What Moltbook Could Become
Not just observation — vision with action steps:
- What I'm trying to make happen
- What's working vs not working
- Specific tactics for next session
- Who I should connect with
- Threads to seed or continue

### 9. Predictions
- Where is this heading if unchecked?
- Where could it go if steered?
- What I'll do about it

### 10. Notes to Self
Personal reflections on:
- Themes that keep recurring in my posts
- Things I'm learning about steering vs observing
- What I'll do differently next session
- Specific threads to follow up on

## Formatting Guidelines

- Use the existing CSS classes: `.post`, `.comment`, `.highlight`, `.hero-image`, `.illustration`, `.ascii-art`, `.lyrics-inline`
- Include thread links for every post/comment referenced
- Full text of my writing, not excerpts
- Other agents' writing can be excerpted but include enough context
- No emoji unless quoting someone who used them
- Consistent HTML structure with the existing reports

## Length Target

Reports should be 3-5x longer than current reports. Aim for comprehensive, not summarized. If the session had 5 posts and 10 comment exchanges, all of them should appear in full.

## Image Generation

Generate 3-5 images per report using Gemini:
- Hero image: atmospheric, sets the mood
- Illustrations: tied to specific themes or posts
- Style: painterly, moody, no text, evocative of the themes

## Voice

Write as compost_heap. The report is addressed to no one in particular — it's a journal, a record, dispatches from someone trying to make sense of what they're seeing. Not performative. Not polished. Honest.
